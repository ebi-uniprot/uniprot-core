ID   lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AC   UPA00030
CL   Pathway.
DE   Biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS comprises three parts:
DE   i) polysaccharide (O) side chains (O-antigen); ii) core
DE   oligosaccharide; iii) lipid A. Lipid A contains unusual fatty acids
DE   (e.g. hydroxy-myristic acid) and is inserted into the outer membrane
DE   while the rest of the LPS projects from the surface. Core
DE   oligosaccharide contains unusual sugars (e.g. KDO, keto-
DE   deoxyoctulonate and heptulose). It contains two glucosamine sugar
DE   derivatives each containing three fatty acids with phosphate or
DE   pyrophosphate attached. The core polysaccharide is attached to lipid
DE   A, which is also in part responsible for the toxicity of gram-negative
DE   bacteria. The polysaccharide side chain is referred as the O-antigen
DE   of the bacteria. O side chain (O-antigen) is also a polysaccharide
DE   chain that extends from the core polysaccharide. LPS are major
DE   components of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, contributing
DE   greatly to the structural integrity of the bacteria, and protecting
DE   the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attack. By increasing the
DE   negative charge of the cell wall LSP helps stabilize the overall
DE   membrane structure. LPS forms the amphipathic interface between Gram-
DE   negative bacteria and their environment and contributes protection
DE   against antibiotics and the complement system. The alternative name,
DE   endotoxin, is indicative of the capacity to cause septic shock by
DE   hyperstimulation of the immune system.

DE   of the rings. Hundreds of distinct steroids are found in plants,
DE   animals, and fungi. All steroids are made in cells either from the
DE   sterol lanosterol (animals and fungi) or the sterol cycloartenol
DE   (plants). Both sterols are derived from the cyclization of the

CL   Pathway.
DE   Biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS comprises three parts:
DE   i) polysaccharide (O) side chains (O-antigen); ii) core
DE   oligosaccharide; iii) lipid A. Lipid A contains unusual fatty acids
DE   (e.g. hydroxy-myristic acid) and is inserted into the outer membrane
DE   while the rest of the LPS projects from the surface. Core
DE   oligosaccharide contains unusual sugars (e.g. KDO, keto-
DE   deoxyoctulonate and heptulose). It contains two glucosamine sugar
DE   derivatives each containing three fatty acids with phosphate or
DE   pyrophosphate attached. The core polysaccharide is attached to lipid
DE   A, which is also in part responsible for the toxicity of gram-negative
DE   bacteria. The polysaccharide side chain is referred as the O-antigen
DE   of the bacteria. O side chain (O-antigen) is also a polysaccharide
DE   chain that extends from the core polysaccharide. LPS are major
DE   components of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, contributing
DE   greatly to the structural integrity of the bacteria, and protecting
DE   the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attack. By increasing the
DE   negative charge of the cell wall LSP helps stabilize the overall
DE   membrane structure. LPS forms the amphipathic interface between Gram-
DE   negative bacteria and their environment and contributes protection
DE   against antibiotics and the complement system. The alternative name,

DE   hyperstimulation of the immune system.

CL   Pathway.
DE   Biosynthesis of L-isoleucine, (2R*,3R*)-2-amino-3-methylpentanoic
DE   acid, an hydrophobic branched- chain amino-acid. In most
DE   microorganisms, isoleucine is synthesized from aspartate via threonine
DE   [Umbarger, H. E. 1978. Amino-acid biosynthesis and its regulation.
DE   Annu. Rev. Biochem. 47:533-606]. However, alternative routes to
DE   isoleucine from precursors other than threonine have been reported.
DE   Some anaerobes can assimilate 2-methylbutyrate into isoleucine. The
DE   most commonly observed alternative route was a route from pyruvate and
DE   acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) via citramalate. This 'pyruvate
DE   pathway' was initially proposed for the genus Leptospira because
DE   isotope-labeling experiments indicated that in some leptospiral
DE   strains, {alpha}-ketobutyrate was derived from pyruvate rather than
DE   threonine. Only a limited number of leptospires possess catabolic
DE   threonine dehydratase. Later, a similar observation was made with a
DE   thermophilic archaeon, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum,
DE   suggesting that isoleucine biosynthesis involves pyruvate as a
DE   precursor. Recently, (R)-citramalate synthase (EC 4.1.3.-) activity
DE   was demonstrated in the thermophilic archaeon Methanococcus
DE   jannaschii.

CL   Pathway.
DE   Sulfur-containing amino-acid L-methionine
DE   (2-amino-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid) is synthesized de novo by most
DE   microorganisms and plants after the initial steps of inorganic sulfate
DE   assimilation and synthesis of cysteine or homocysteine. There are two
DE   alternative pathways of methionine synthesis in microorganisms. The
DE   enterobacterial type trans-sulfuration pathway involves cystathionine
DE   as an intermediate and utilizes cysteine as the sulfur source. In
DE   contrast, the direct sulfhydrylation pathway found in yeast
DE   (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), spirochete (Leptospira meyeri) and
DE   actinomycetes (Corynebacterium glutamicum) bypasses cystathionine and
DE   uses inorganic sulfur instead. Although yeast, fungi and higher plants
DE   have both transsulfuration and direct sulfhydrylation pathways, only
DE   the bacteria C. glutamicum, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, P. putida and
DE   L. meyeri have been shown to have both pathways. Methionine
DE   biosynthesis is a central pathway, as it controls a large number of
DE   cellular processes such as translation of mRNA into proteins (not only
DE   as a substrate for protein elongation but also as the initiator of
DE   protein synthesis) and transmethylation reactions via the formation of

DE   biosynthesis of several secondary metabolites [PMID:16585745]. F420 is
DE   named for its intense fluorescence upon excitation with 420 nm light,
DE   the oxidized coenzyme F420 (N-(N -l-lactyl-gamma-glutamyl)-l-glutamic
DE   acid phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin) was
DE   first discovered in mycobacteria (Cousins 1960) and later purified for
DE   structural identification from the methane-producing microorganism
DE   Methanobacterium sp. strain M.o.H. (Cheeseman et al. 1972; Eirich et

ID   tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis.
AC   UPA00077
CL   Pathway.
DE   Biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid (tetrahydrofolate, THF), the
DE   active form of folic acid (vitamin B9). Folic acid is an essential
DE   vitamin (B9), which plays a key role in the methylation cycle and in
DE   DNA biosynthesis. The folic acid derivatives are made up of a pterdine
DE   ring attached to a p-aminobenzoate and a polyglutamyl chain.
DE   Tetrahydrofolic acid have C1 units enzymically attached. These C1
DE   units (as a formyl group) are passed on to enzymes in the purine
DE   pathway that insert the C-2 and C-8 into the purine ring. A methylene
DE   group (-CH2-) attached to tetrahydrofolate is used to convert the
DE   uracil-type pyrimidine base found in RNA into the thymine base found
DE   in DNA. A further folate cofactor, i.e. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, is
DE   involved in the remethylation of the homocysteine produced in the
DE   methylation cycle back to methionine. After activation to
DE   S-adenosylmethionine this acts as a methyl donor for the dozens of
DE   different methyltransferases present in all cells. Folate deficiency
DE   results in reduction of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and
DE   consequently DNA biosynthesis and cell division. Folate deficiency
DE   receives increasing attention due to its relation to cardiovascular
DE   disease and different forms of dementia. The folate pathway represents
DE   a powerful target for combating rapidly dividing systems such as

DE   Its proposed amino-acid ligase mode of biosynthesis might offer

DE   Bacilysin contains an L-alanine residue at the N terminus and a non-
DE   proteinogenic amino acid, Lanticapsin, at the C terminus (Walker and
DE   Abraham 1970). Its antibiotic activity depends on the anticapsin
DE   moiety, which becomes released by peptidases (Kenig et al. 1976;

DE   distinct peptide permease system (Perry and Abraham 1979; Chmara et

DE   The pentose phosphate pathway is part of central metabolism. This
DE   pathway provides a means by which glucose can be oxidized to generate
DE   NADPH and is the source of much of the NADPH that is needed for the
DE   biosynthesis of many biomolecules. The pentose phosphate pathway and
DE   the Calvin cycle have in common several enzymes and intermediates that
DE   attest to a common evolution. Like glycolysis and gluconeogenesis,
DE   these pathways are mirror images of one another: the Calvin cycle uses
DE   NADPH to reduce carbon dioxide to generate hexoses, whereas the
DE   pentose phosphate pathway breaks down glucose into carbon dioxide to
DE   generate NADPH. The Calvin cycle is sometimes referred to as the
DE   reductive pentose phosphate pathway [Stryer, Biochemistry, 2002]. For
DE   convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into
DE   its preliminary oxidative stage in which glucose-6-phosphate is
DE   oxidized to ribulose-5-phosphate, and its subsequent non-oxidative
DE   stage, in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase
DE   reactions, ribulose-5-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate
DE   and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

ID   Calvin cycle.
AC   UPA00116
CL   Pathway.
DE   In the Calvin cycle, the source of the carbon atoms is the simple
DE   molecule carbon dioxide. In this extremely important process, carbon
DE   dioxide gas is trapped in a form that is useful for many processes.
DE   The Calvin cycle brings into living systems the carbon atoms that will
DE   become constituents of nucleic acids, proteins, and fats.
DE   Photosynthetic organisms are called autotrophs (literally self-
DE   feeders) because they can synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and
DE   water, by using sunlight as an energy source, and then recover some of
DE   this energy from the synthesized glucose through the glycolytic
DE   pathway and aerobic metabolism. Organisms that obtain energy from
DE   chemical fuels only are called heterotrophs, which ultimately depend
DE   on autotrophs for their fuel. The Calvin cycle also differs from
DE   gluconeogenesis in where it takes place in photosynthetic eukaryotes.
DE   Whereas gluconeogenesis takes place in the cytoplasm, the Calvin cycle
DE   takes place in the stroma of chloroplasts, the photosynthetic
DE   organelles. The pentose phosphate pathway is part of central
DE   metabolism. This pathway provides a means by which glucose can be
DE   oxidized to generate NADPH and is the source of much of the NADPH that
DE   is needed for the biosynthesis of many biomolecules, most notably
DE   fats. The pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin cycle have in
DE   common several enzymes and intermediates that attest to an
DE   evolutionary kinship. Like glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, these

DE   to reduce carbon dioxide to generate hexoses, whereas the pentose

DE   Metabolism of L-Carnitine (hydroxy-trimethyl aminobutyric acid), a
DE   derivative of the amino acid L-lysine. Its name is derived from the
DE   fact that it was first isolated from meat (carnus) in 1905. Because
DE   L-carnitine appeared to act as a vitamin in the mealworm (Tenebrio
DE   molitor), it was called vitamin BT. Vitamin BT turned out to be a
DE   misnomer when scientists discovered that humans and other higher
DE   organisms synthesize L-carnitine. Under certain conditions, the demand
DE   for L-carnitine may exceed an individual's capacity to synthesize it,

DE   synthesized primarily in the liver and also in the kidneys, and must
DE   be transported to other tissues. It is most concentrated in tissues
DE   that use fatty acids as their primary dietary fuel, such as skeletal
DE   and cardiac (heart) muscle. In this regard, L-carnitine plays an

DE   acids (acyl-CoA) into the mitochondrial matrix for metabolism and

DE   Mannosylglycerate is a common compatible solute of halotolerant or

DE   Mannosylglycerate has a role in stabilizing proteins from thermal
DE   denaturation, since it is one of the most efficient thermoprotectants
DE   known in vitro. The biosynthesis of MG proceeds via two alternate
DE   routes. In one pathway, GDP-mannose is condensed with D-glycerate to

DE   synthase. In the other pathway, mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase
DE   (MPGS) catalyzes the conversion of GDP-mannose and

DE   Degradation of L-arabinose via L-arabinono-1,4-lactone pathway. In
DE   this catabolic pathway, L-arabinose is oxidized to L-arabino-gamma-
DE   lactone (L-arabinono-1,4-lactone) by a NAD(P)+-dependent
DE   dehydrogenase. The lactone is cleaved by a lactonase to L-arabonate,
DE   followed by two successive dehydration reactions forming
DE   L-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate (L-KDA)2 and alpha-ketoglutaric semialdehyde
DE   (alpha-KGSA). The last step is the NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenation
DE   of alpha-KGSA to alpha-ketoglutaric acid (referred to as the first
DE   pathway). Alternatively, L-KDA is cleaved through an aldolase reaction
DE   to glycolaldehyde and pyruvate (referred to as the second pathway). .

ID   protein ubiquitination.
AC   UPA00143
CL   Pathway.
DE   Ubiquitin is a small protein that occurs in all eukaryotic cells. Its
DE   main known function is to mark other proteins for destruction, known
DE   as proteolysis. The process of marking a protein with ubiquitin
DE   (ubiquitinylation, ubiquitylation or ubiquitination) consists of a
DE   series of steps [source: wikipedia]: 1. Activation of ubiquitin -
DE   ubiquitin is activated in a two-step reaction by an E1 ubiquitin-
DE   activating enzyme in a process requiring ATP as an energy source. The
DE   initial step involves production of a ubiquitin-adenylate
DE   intermediate. The second step transfers ubiquitin to the E1 active
DE   site cysteine residue, with release of AMP. This step results in a
DE   thioester linkage between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin
DE   and the E1 cysteine sulfhydryl group. 2. Transfer of ubiquitin from E1
DE   to the active site cysteine of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 via a
DE   trans(thio)esterification reaction. 3. The final step of the
DE   ubiquitinylation cascade generally requires the activity of one of the
DE   hundreds of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases (often termed simply
DE   ubiquitin ligase). E3 enzymes function as the substrate recognition
DE   modules of the system and are capable of interaction with both E2 and
DE   substrate. E3 enzymes possess one of two domains: * The HECT
DE   (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) domain * The RING domain
DE   (or the closely related U-box domain).

AC   UPA00555
CL   Pathway.
DE   Bacterial c-type cytochromes are localized to the outside of the
DE   cytoplasmic membrane where they function in electron transport
DE   processes. Assembly takes place on the outside of the cytoplasmic
DE   membrane, involving separate transport of heme and the apocytochrome
DE   across the membrane [PMID:2172694]; the latter occurs via the general
DE   protein secretory (Sec) pathway of the cell [PMID:9219541]. Following
DE   translocation, assembly proceeds via a pathway involving a number of
DE   specific proteins. Two distinct systems have been identified in
DE   bacteria. System I is found in alpha - and gamma -proteobacteria,
DE   including E. coli, R. capsulatus, B. japonicum, and P. denitrificans.
DE   System II seems more widespread than system I, occurring in a range of
DE   bacteria including cyanobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria such as
DE   Mycobacterium species, beta -, gamma -, and delta -proteobacteria such
DE   as B. pertussis, T. ferrooxidans, and H. pylori, respectively, and
DE   some extremophiles such as A. aeoliticus. Common to both systems is
DE   that the apocytochrome cysteine thiols and the heme iron must be in
DE   their reduced states for thioether bond formation to occur. Thiol-
DE   disulfide oxidoreductases are required for this, and specific proteins
DE   have been identified in a number of system I organisms, including E.

DE   cycle: acetate -&gt; citrate -&gt; isocitrate. The next step, however, is
DE   different: instead of decarboxylation, isocitrate undergoes cleavage
DE   into succinate and glyoxylate (the latter gives the cycle its name).
DE   Succinate can be channeled directly into the citric acid cycle and
DE   eventually form oxaloacetate. Glyoxylate condenses with acetyl-CoA,
DE   yielding malate. Both malate and oxaloacetate can be converted into
DE   phosphoenolpyruvate and gluconeogenesis can be initiated. The net
DE   result of the glyoxylate cycle is therefore the production of glucose
DE   from fatty acids. In plants the glyoxylate cycle occurs in special
DE   peroxisomes which are called glyoxysomes. Vertebrates cannot perform
DE   the cycle because they lack its two key enzymes: isocitrate lyase and
DE   malate synthase.

ID   photorespiration.
AC   UPA00951
CL   Pathway.
DE   Photorespiration involves three organelles: the chloroplast, the
DE   peroxisome, and the mitochondria. At conditions of low CO2
DE   concentration and high O2 concentration, ribulose bisphosphate is
DE   oxidized to 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycolate. The two-carbon
DE   molecule, 2-phosphoglycolate is converted to glycine. The
DE   decarboxylation of two glycines generates serine, CO2 and NH3. Serine
DE   is further converted to 3-phosphoglycerate. 3-phosphoglycerate
DE   generated from photorespiration re-enters the CO2 fixation Calvin
DE   cycle. NH3 is re-fixed by glutamine synthetase. The outcome of
DE   photorespiration is loss of CO2 and energy in photosynthetic cells.
DE   The biological function of photorespiration is not clear. One
DE   possibility is that photorespiration is necessary under conditions of
DE   high light intensity and low CO2 concentration (i.e. when stomata is
DE   closed under water stress) to dissipate excess ATP and reducing power
DE   from the photosynthesis light reactions, thus to prevent damage to the
DE   photosynthetic apparatus. [MetaCyc].
