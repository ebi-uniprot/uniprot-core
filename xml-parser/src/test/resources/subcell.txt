ID   Plastid.
AC   SL-0209
DE   The plastid is a semi-autonomous, self-reproducing organelle. Plastids
DE   are remnants of a photosynthetic organism that was engulfed by the
DE   host, although not all are now photosynthetic. Plastid genomes encode
DE   genes for rRNAs, tRNAs and between about 28 and 150 proteins. Plastids
DE   can be categorized in 4 main groups: chloroplasts, cyanelles,
DE   apicoplasts and non-photosynthetic. The later is found is some land
DE   plants (Epifagus virginiana), chlorophyte algae (Prototheca
DE   wickerhamii) and euglenoids (Astasis longa), which do not encode the
DE   genes necessary for photosynthesis and so are not photosynthetic but
DE   still contain a plastid. They probably do not contain thylakoids.

ID   Golgi apparatus.
AC   SL-0132
DE   The Golgi apparatus is a series of flattened, cisternal membranes and
DE   similar vesicles usually arranged in close apposition to each other to
DE   form stacks. In mammalian cells, the Golgi apparatus is juxtanuclear,
DE   often pericentriolar. The stacks are connected laterally by tubules to
DE   create a perinuclear ribbon structure, the 'Golgi ribbon'. In plants
DE   and lower animal cells, the Golgi exists as many copies of discrete
DE   stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The Golgi is a polarized
DE   structure with, in most higher eukaryotic cells, a cis-face associated
DE   with a tubular reticular network of membranes facing the endoplasmic
DE   reticulum, the cis-Golgi network (CGN), a medial area of disk-shaped
DE   flattened cisternae, and a trans-face associated with another tubular
DE   reticular membrane network, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) directed
DE   toward the plasma membrane and compartments of the endocytic pathway.
DE   The Golgi apparatus receives the entire output of de novo synthesized
DE   polypeptides from the ER, and functions to posttranslationally process
DE   and sort them within vesicles destined to their proper final
DE   destination (e.g. plasma membrane, endosomes, lysosomes).

ID   Golgi stack.
AC   SL-0135
DE   The Golgi stack consist of a series of flattened curved and parallel
DE   series saccules, called cisternae or dictyosomes, that form the
DE   central portion of the Golgi complex. The stack usually comprises cis,
DE   medial, and trans cisternae; the cis- and trans-Golgi networks are not
DE   considered part of the stack.

ID   Nucleus.
AC   SL-0191
DE   The nucleus is the most obvious organelle in any eukaryotic cell. It
DE   is a membrane-bound organelle surrounded by double membranes which
DE   contains most of the cell's genetic material. It communicates with the
DE   surrounding cytosol via numerous nuclear pores.

ID   Cajal body.
AC   SL-0031
DE   The nuclear Cajal bodies (CBs) are small subnuclear membraneless
DE   organelles present either free in the nucleoplasm and/or physically
DE   associated to specific regions of chromatin. CBs contain newly
DE   assembled small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and small
DE   nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) particles, which are involved
DE   in pre-mRNA splicing and in ribosomal RNA processing, respectively.
DE   Mammalian nucleus in interphase, show 2-6 CBs, as irregular, punctuate
DE   structures, which vary in size and shape and which are often
DE   juxtaposed to nucleoli. At the electronic-microscope level, they are
DE   composed of heterogeneous mixture of electro-dense particles with
DE   diameters ranging from 20-25 nm and are called coiled body. Structures
DE   similar to CBs have been identified in the amphibian oocyte nucleus
DE   (called sphere organelles) and in insect (called endobodies). CBs are
DE   motile and dynamic structures. Both their protein and RNA-protein
DE   components can cycle continuously between CBs and other nuclear
DE   locations depending on the transcriptional state of the cell.
